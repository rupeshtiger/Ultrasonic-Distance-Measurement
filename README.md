# Ultrasonic-Distance-Measurement
The HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor measures distance by emitting high-frequency sound waves and timing how long it takes for the echoes to return. It consists of a transmitter that sends out an ultrasonic pulse and a receiver that listens for the reflected pulse. The sensor calculates the distance based on the time delay.
